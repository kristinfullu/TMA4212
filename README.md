The projects in this course had our group work with discretizing domains with different constraints, and implementing solutions using irregular grids. 
In project 1, the topic at hand was finite difference methods, whilst project 2 dealt with finite element methods. 

Grades obtained:
Project 1: 15/20
Project 2: 18/20
Total grade: B
